Planetary Orbit Simulation with VPython

Overview
This project is a visual simulation of a planet revolving around a sun using the VPython library. It demonstrates the principles of gravitational dynamics and allows users to interactively explore how different parameters affect the planet's orbit. The simulation includes a real-time graph plotting the kinetic energy of the planet against its distance from the sun.

Features
- Real-time 3D visualization of a planet orbiting a sun.
- Interactive user interface for adjusting simulation parameters:
  - Planet's initial position (x, y)
  - Planet's initial velocity (vx, vy)
  - Time step (dt)
  - Gravitational constant (G)
  - Mass of the sun (M)
- Display of the gravitational force formula used in the simulation.
- Graph plotting the kinetic energy of the planet against its distance from the sun.

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- VPython library

Installation
1. Install Python 3.x from the official website: https://www.python.org/
2. Install the VPython library using pip:


Usage
1. Run the simulation script in a Python environment that supports VPython (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or a standalone Python script executed in a terminal).
2. Use the input fields in the UI to set the initial parameters for the simulation.
3. Click the "Update Parameters" button to apply the changes and restart the simulation.
4. Observe the planet's motion and the real-time graph of kinetic energy vs. distance.

Insights
- The simulation provides a practical demonstration of Newton's law of universal gravitation.
- Users can explore the sensitivity of orbital dynamics to initial conditions and physical constants.
- The real-time graph offers insights into the relationship between kinetic energy and orbital distance, illustrating concepts like conservation of energy.

Educational Value
This project serves as an educational tool for students and enthusiasts to visualize and experiment with gravitational forces and orbital mechanics. It enhances understanding through interactive exploration and real-time feedback.

Extensibility
The code is modular and can be extended to include additional features, such as plotting other parameters or adding more celestial bodies. Error handling ensures robust user interaction.
